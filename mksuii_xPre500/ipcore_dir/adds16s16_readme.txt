   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

adds16s16.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

adds16s16.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.
