Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   15

  Number of Slice Registers:                    26 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  26
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         23 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as logic:                       23 out of  19,200    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              23

  Number of occupied Slices:                    24 out of   4,800    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           47
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            21 out of      47   44%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  24 out of      47   51%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           2 out of      47    4%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of  19,200    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        68 out of     360   18%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             37

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.07

Peak Memory Usage:  292 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  17 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   14 secs

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
