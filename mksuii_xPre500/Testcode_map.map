Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   15
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    26 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  26
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         23 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as logic:                       23 out of  19,200    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              23

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    24 out of   4,800    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           47
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            21 out of      47   44%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  24 out of      47   51%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           2 out of      47    4%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of  19,200    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        68 out of     360   18%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             37

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.07
